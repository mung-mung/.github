# Mung Mung

## Intro
### Objective
This project intermediates dog walking services between dog owners and dog walkers. If development proceeds as planned, we intend to provide walker training programs for the retired senior population to recruit seniors as walker personnel. This potential expansion aims to serve as an exemplary case of integrating the senior community with the broader society, facilitating intergenerational cohesion, and addressing the evolving demographic structure.
### Service Flow
Owners can register their dogs and post job articles specifically for their pets. Walkers can view all posted job articles and apply for those that suit them. Owners then have the option to choose from the applicant walkers and engage in a chat (this chat feature is currently under development) to finalize the contract.
